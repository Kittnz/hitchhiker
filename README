Fortytwo
========

Nothing more than a cleaned up version of The Hitchhiker's Hack.

Not recommended at all since it writes in process memory which means you'll
get caught using it. (That's why nobody uses it anymore.) There are better
alternatives now that get attached as debuggers and use SetThreadContext to
change the EIP and all of that to alter the behaviour of the game without
writing in addresses that are checked by Warden/Sentinel/whatever.
